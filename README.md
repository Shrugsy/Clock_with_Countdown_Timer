# Clock_with_Countdown_Timer
This project was created to demonstrate the use of react.js in combination with electron. The basis of this is from https://github.com/csepulv/electron-with-create-react-app

The project itself is intended to be a large desktop clock with a toggleable timer (similar to the functionality of the google timer)

Run using `npm run dev` (this uses Node Foreman to start React & Electron based on the procfile commands).

Build using `npm run pack`.
